api call in js
--------------
AJAX
-XMLhttp
-fetch
-asynch await

useEffect is the hook used instead of ngoninit


redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom          npm i react-router-dom


import{
    BrowserRouter as Router  - all roting need components
    Routes                   - to set paths for each components
    Route                    - more than one path
}


useParams  - hook used to access params from component url


REDUX
------
coupling  -- many connections between parent and child component

props drilling-- in coupling if any intermediaate component have any errors,
                 all other childs will not work.

    to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the component independent

    for this react introduce a new technology - state management technology - REDUX



redux process
--------------

create a new js file to keep the states , all the components can access the js file


- the components only can access the datas from js file . but they cant update datas in js file


          Reducer   ------------------------------->   Data.js +
             | 
                                                       state
             ^                                            |
                                                          |
             ^  response as payload                       |
                                                          |
             ^                                            |
                                                          |
                                                          |
             ^                                             
         Action < -------------------------------   component     
        logic             dispatch


Action - a file with all the logics to update the state
Dispatch - method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation
Reducer - update the dtatas in js file according to the payload response get action file


libraries to apply redux
------------------------

1.REDUX
2.REACT-REDUX
3.REDUX-THUNK

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() - method in REDUX used to craete store in js file
              - 2 argunemts
              - 1. reducer  
              - 2. middleware  - used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous

applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all reducers in js file


thunk  - in REDUX-THUNK  - used to create middleware


1. create store
2. apply the store in index.js


AXIOS   -- module used to make http methods {api call}  -- npm i axios

useDispatch - hook used to dispatch actions in components  - react-redux



To access datas from store to components  - useSelector  - hook
